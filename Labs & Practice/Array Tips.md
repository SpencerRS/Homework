#How to Form Arrays
###By $pizzy RiÂ¢h

An array is a static data structed established by using []
 
An ArrayList is a dynamic data structure created using a method and <>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must use "import java.util.ArrayList;" in order to use an ArrayList.

All arrays, both arrays and ArrayLists are 0 indexed. That means the first value is stored at 0, the second at 1, the third at 2, etc.

Consult the following code snippet for an example of how to form an ArrayList:

```
		ArrayList<Integer> lostNum = new ArrayList<>();
        lostNum.add(4);
        lostNum.add(8);
        lostNum.add(15);
        lostNum.add(16);
        lostNum.add(23);
        lostNum.add(42); 
```

You will be successful with arrays as long as you do the following:

* consult an example before you begin structuring your array
* use ArrayList whenver possible
* Practice and double check your work.
