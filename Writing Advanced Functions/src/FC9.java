//Write a function that asks the user to enter a country domain. If the user types in "us", the function prints out "United States", if the user enters "de", the function prints out "Germany", if the user types in "hu" the response should be "Hungary". In all other cases the function should print out "Unknown". Please try to use a switch statement and make sure the function works with a user's input of lower and upper case strings.
